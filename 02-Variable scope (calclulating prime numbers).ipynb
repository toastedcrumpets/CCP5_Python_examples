    "# Part 02 - Correct use of variable scope\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of notes is about building a program from scratch (the development process), learning to think in loops, and <b>learning about scope</b>, one of the most confusing parts of programming for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>scope</b> is everything the computer can \"see\" at a particular point in the code, i.e. the names of variables and functions the computer has learnt (so far). We have to learn about scope, as many errors arise from not understanding it, and you want to keep your scope as minimal/clean as possible so that errors are easy to find. Also, scope is fundamental to understanding how code is read by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate it, we are going to build a prime number calculator!\n",
    "\n",
    "Prime numbers are natural numbers (positive integers) which have only themselves and 1 as factors. Thus 2 is a prime number and so is 3, but not 4 as $2\\times2=4$. There are no simple patterns to the primes. In fact, as soon as a pattern appears it seems to be destroyed. For example, between the first two primes (2,3) it appears to be increasing by 1, but this is immediately broken by the next prime being 5. We might then hypothesise the increase in the primes to be +1,+2,+3 but then the next prime (7) is actually a +2 again! In fact, \"seives\" are one way of identifying primes by removing the patterns prime numbers create once they are discovered. For example, as the number 2 is prime, all other even numbers are no-longer prime. See the [seive of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) for more on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some general statements we can make about primes, such as the probability of a number, $n$, being prime is proportional to $1/\\ln(n)$ for sufficiently large $n$, but there is no fast way to test if a number is prime. Most approaches instead check if a number is *not* prime by looking for factors. If there are no integer factors then it is prime. This is known as [trial division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division), where given a candidate prime number $n$, we test every integer less than $n$ to see if it divides $n$ an integer number of times.\n",
